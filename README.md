# Project Overview: Responsive Web Design
This project is a responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a structured navigation menu with a dropdown, a main content section with images, and a footer. The design incorporates flexbox and grid layouts for displaying images consistently, ensuring a clean and modern look. A mobile-friendly approach is used, with a media query hiding certain elements on smaller screens and adjusting layouts dynamically.

# Part 1: HTML Structure
In this phase, the HTML file (index.html) was created with a semantic structure, including:
- A header with a welcome message
- A navigation bar featuring a dropdown menu
- A main content area with an article, images, and a sidebar
- A footer with copyright information
The article contains a description and multiple images, displayed using grid and flexbox containers. This phase focused on setting up the content and ensuring proper markup for accessibility and clarity.

# Part 2: CSS Styling & Responsiveness
The CSS file (styles.css) was added to enhance the website’s appearance. Key styling features included:
- CSS Variables (:root) for consistent spacing and font sizes
- Dropdown Menu Styling to create a hover effect
- Flexbox & Grid Layouts for aligning images properly
- Media Queries to adjust elements on smaller screens (hiding the sidebar & footer)
- Hover Effects & Shadows for better user interaction
This phase ensured that the design was modern, responsive, and visually appealing across different devices.

# Part 3: Responsive Web Design & Advanced CSS
This phase introduced Responsive Web Design (RWD) concepts and advanced CSS techniques to improve flexibility and maintainability. Key enhancements included:
- CSS Variables (:root) for consistent measurements and scalability
- Relative Units (rem, vw, em) to ensure adaptability across different screen sizes
- CSS Functions (calc(), linear-gradient()) for dynamic sizing and styling effects
- Improved Dropdown Menu with hover effects and box shadows
- Flexbox & Grid Refinements for better image alignment and responsiveness
- Media Queries to adjust layouts for mobile devices (hiding sidebar & footer)
- Smooth Hover Transitions using cubic-bezier() for interactive elements
This phase made the website fully responsive, scalable, and visually polished across all devices.

# Part 4: Bootstrap Learning Hub
- Created a single-page responsive website (hw4.html) using the Bootstrap 4 framework
- Used stacked containers with rows and Bootstrap’s 12-column grid layout (col-md-*, col-lg-*)
- Included a navigation bar with a dropdown menu for structured site navigation
- Designed a hero section with a soft blue background and centered intro text
- Added an "About This Page" section with a main description and sidebar for quick facts
- Applied utility classes (bg-*, text-*, btn-outline-*) for consistent styling
- Integrated components such as cards, tabs, buttons, and responsive forms
- Focused on typography, spacing, and layout for clarity, visual appeal, and accessibility
